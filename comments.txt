why are they wearing headphones and microphones? are they taking calls? they are sitting together in one room
Love this and love you guys!!
Roman was too powerful to be the lead in avatar, James Cameron wanted the film to be obviously a film. With Romans acting it would’ve fooled people to think this was a documentary on real events.
Of course.  How dare you guys think we don&#39;t follow you closely with a magnifying glass.<br>Shame <b>ding ding</b><br>Shame <b>Ding Ding</b><br>Shame <b>Ding Ding</b><br>Shame <b>Ding Ding</b><br>Shame <b>Ding Ding</b>
Despite being just an extra, it must have been cool to be on that legendary set.
Rowan was also in an episode of Legend of the seeker.
Rowan was actually looking at soldiers performance numbers to see who would get a paycut.
Hey guys! Please sort your sound out. It is so sharp. It is very straining on the ears. Listen to your chapters in Viva and then this. It is very sharp.
I always thought this was just a meme.
At this point James should let you guys do bored: avatar edition. <br>&quot;Scatman, you can&#39;t keep running out of the depot. You&#39;re a marine&quot;
DYKRWIA?
I saw him there when rewatching some time ago :)
Suggestion: You have some odd camera placement that you should correct. Every time there is a shot of Adam talking to Rowan I feel as though Adam is looking too far to his right (Rowan&#39;s left.) It&#39;s distracting. Adam&#39;s camera needs to be moved closer to Rowan to get a more full-on view of Adam, and/or Adam&#39;s chair should be turned slightly counterclockwise (left from his point of view)  or Rowan&#39;s chair should be moved further towards Rowan&#39;s left (closer to Alan.)
Rowan, if you keep being that conceited, I will be forced to do something I have only done once and under the same circumstance... I Will Not Finish The Something I Started.... I do not like not knowing things because everything I say when I said it is true and irksome egos are why I cannot enjoy most things and Rowan; your head must be made of wood because I can hear ya rowin&#39; up that stream....
wow....anyways.
So what?!? Hamish was In Hunt for the Wilderpeople!
Shout out @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkm9INMlaHI&amp;t=622">10:22</a> to the staff at the back walking down the stairs for lunch or coffee and giving a wave just to be featured on screen for a second!
😂😂😂 I was in the NZ Army in 1999 and they used us as Extras on LOTR Fellowship of the Ring 💍 😂😂😂
That&#39;s fucking crazy.
Uninspired, lazy *ss, content. Also, hire Celestia_pretty_star from the comment section. She will make your podcasts interesting.
Lol 10 minutes and 32 seconds people walking around in the background was that Ben exiting the building lol outrageous
Usually I&#39;d love to look for Scatman, but unfortunately that would mean I&#39;d have to watch Avatar again
DYKRWIA
Is that Jesus on your laptop 😂😂😂 Adam 😂😂😂
It’s about time you all admitted Rowan was in Avatar. I’ve seen videos of it on YouTube. What else are trying to hide???
Rowan&#39;s scene was at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkm9INMlaHI&amp;t=8399">2:19:59</a> in the version I watched
Yes because he tells us at every opportunity 😂😂😂
Now we&#39;re gonna learn Bodger was an avatar all along... of which God...?
Yeah.  I saw him front row when the lunatic military leader was justifying the pre-emptive strike on the natives.  Typical Rowan, on the wrong side.
that wasnt Rowan in the briefing room, it was Rowaa, he&#39;s not French, he&#39;s actually from Kansas, but he&#39;s not in Kansas anymore.
Im only a few minutes in but i hope this talks about all his roles. He was in Spartacus!!! 😮 i wanna know all the things he was in
Holy 💩t  i forwarded it and there Rowan is sat at the front  😂
@Viva Why are you re-releasing the podcast episodes.
i love how  RWIA is like the most sustaining and lingering force in the whole VLDL fandom lol
My all time favorite movie!! Just went back and BOOM! There’s Rowan
Rewatched Avatar a few years back, and I noticed Rowan sat in a chair in that one scene, was like &quot;wait is that Rowan??&quot; in a very visually confused state, looked up the scene on imdb and found out quickly it was him :D
Was it the dumbest person you know that said you should do a podcast?
Can you guys please not be so funny and just take things seriously for once…
Yeah, yeah, Alan. We ALL know you were in Avatar, big man. <br><br>Ok, Rowan, please continue telling us your amazing story of how you played a role in Avatar.  😂
I watched it with my girlfriend and paused it and said &quot;I think I just saw Rowan&quot;
Epic Avatar man!!!
Had to pause it, and go look immediately lol
Lol I saw that one that was so where you guys were saying that Rowan was in Avatar lol I have it on my Disney Plus I&#39;m totally going to check it out <a href="UCchBatdUMZoMfJ3rIzgV84g/Nr4XZOeiKsKI9wa07InYBQ"></a>
yes
Rowan was also in Spartacus (S02E08). He doesn&#39;t wear a shirt. And gets killed by Gannicus.
I have a DVD of avatar, why would I go onto streaming service?
Rowan been in avtar made the movie BEST acting ever
Just scanned Avatar and they you are...cool.
If you had made it, we wouldn’t have you here…so your suffering is our gain.
How about Rowan being in Spartacus?!
My uncle was in avatar
omg that WAS Rowan in the Movie Sitting down/front row with that Small Little White Torch on him  OMG you weren&#39;t BSing. I just Went To Disney and Went To Avatar at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkm9INMlaHI&amp;t=126">2:06</a>  and Right in Front of the General Sitting Down is Rowan!!!
We finally get to know the story of the legendary moment 🤩
What? Rowan is an Airbender?
wow- twas early 🔥
Nice day for fishin! Huh-hah!
He was???? He&#39;s never mentioned it even once, he definitely wouldn&#39;t be the sort of person to have a hot key for the clip
Was rowan a stuntman?<br>&#39;episode&#39; u don&#39;t mean the blue films u mean the anime?
If you didn’t come from TikTok raise your hand ✋🏽
Whaaaat ? Really ??? It surprises me so far !!!!
Look&#39;s like Rowan the Manager is expanding the business beyond the stars to get more underpaid workers.
There is still 1 person on earth who is not aware of that?
the best podcast fr
A great episode. Listen to every podcast every Tuesday on the way home from work. Doing an amazing job guys
Scatman deserves a spin off. Can’t believe Rowan was in avatar?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Wait! There is a pod cast??? Gotta go back to ep1 apparently
I listened to all these on Spotify already cuz they came out first, if the video podcasts every catch up to Spotify, or they get released at the same time, I&#39;d probably be more inclined to watch the video
No he wasn&#39;t!
63rd
My first podcast from them lol it’s great

I have to say I think the podcast is much better if I can see you guys, just the audio makes it very hard for me to follow
